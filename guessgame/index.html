            <h2>About the end of support for GuessGame...</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                        First of all, RVH Productions wants to thank all of those who have played GuessGame since it's release on December 13, 2020.<br>
                        Support for GuessGame has ended on July 1st, 2025 after nearly five years of development.<br>
                        <br>
                        The choice to cease development has been made because the old code base is difficult to work with, as some<br>
                        of the old code originally written in 2020 is still present in the latest development build of GuessGame.<br>
                        <br>
                        Continuing serious development on the game would require me to rewrite huge parts, if not all of the game.<br>
                        However, given the product's age, I've chosen to let it rest.<br>
                        <br>
                        Online endpoints for GuessGame 1.4, 1.5 and the 1.6 Beta will remain active until at least January 1st, 2026.<br>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Again, thank you for playing GuessGame. It has been an amazing ride!<br>
