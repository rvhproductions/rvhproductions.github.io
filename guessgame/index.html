            <h3>Notice</h3>
            <p>
                As Windows 8.1 gets older, some things in GuessGame that require Networking may stop functioning when playing on the operating system.<br>
                RVH Productions has therefore decided to stop supporting Windows 8.1, and GuessGame will require Windows 10.<br>
                GuessGame will however continue to attempt to run on Windows 8.1 and there will not be hardcoded restrictions.
