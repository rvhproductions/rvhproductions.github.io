            <h2>Introducing InfRunner</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>
                RVH Productions is happy to announce: <b>InfRunner</b>.<br>
                This is a new game by RVH Productions. This page will tell you what InfRunner (currently) is, and what features are planned.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Infinite running game</b><br>
                InfRunner is an endless running game, where the player needs to get as much score as possible without crashing into an enemy.<br>
                At the same time, the player needs to collect multiplier coins, which increases the score multiplier.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Planned features</b><br>
                Multiplayer! This is a feature that is currently being worked on.<br>
                Worlds created by players! In the near future, player can make their own worlds, and can add songs to their world.<br>
                A gamemode, called Timed! This gamemode means getting as much score as possible before a song is over. This gamemode can only be played on worlds with a song.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Free to play!</b><br>
                InfRunner will be free to play for everyone, without advertisements, no in-app purchases, nothing of that nonsense.
