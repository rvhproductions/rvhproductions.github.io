                Have you ever imagined a game... where you can shoot? Sure.<br>
                Have you ever imagined a game... where you can shoot your semen? Maybe that's a little harder to imagine.<br>
                Thankfully, you don't have to imagine it anymore.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Introducing Pussy Shooter</b>, a brand new game from RVH Productions.<br>
                On this page I will tell you what Pussy Shooter currently is, what's planned and when it releases.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>Infinite pussy shooting game</b><br>
                Pussy Shooter is an endless pussy shooting game. On the Cumfield you must shoot your semen at every pussy that comes falling down.<br>
                The pussys are sometimes Legendary, but they can also be very common and sometimes not nice at all!<br>
                Be sure not to shoot the condoms. You will be wrapped around one and will not be able to shoot anymore.<br>
                <br>
                <br>
                <b>And more...</b><br>
